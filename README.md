# Retainless

**Privacy-first app analytics that matter.**

Retainless is a sever-side analytics platform for measuring your app's success. Access logs never leave your cloud
account, and there is no tracking code and no cookies.

## retainless-collector

This code is the core gathering agent for Retainless, running in your cloud account to process and store data. It can be
deployed to [AWS](#install-aws) or [GCP](#install-gcp) and others coming soon. The [Architecture](#architecture) should
match regardless of cloud provider.

### Getting Started

1. **[Prepare](#prepare)**: Enabling access logs is the first step of using Retainless.
1. **[Install](#install)**: Deploying the `retainless-collector` processing code will digest these logs.
1. **[Analyze](#analyze)**: Use [Retainless Cloud](https://retainless.com) or the [CLI](#analyze-cli) to view your app
   metrics.

#### Prepare

Your app must log access requests to *CloudWatch Logs* or *GCP Cloud Logging*. For services that sample requests, they
should be set to `100%` (all requests).

In general, we recommend a CDN, but cloud servers usually can be configured for managed logging.

The retention period must be at least `2 days`, but you may want longer log storage in case an error requires you to
reprocess access logs. Since access logs contain IP addresses, they are considered personal data, so shorter is better.

#### Install

##### Install: AWS

Terraform:

```terraform
module "retainless" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/retainless/retainless-collector.git//aws/terraform"

  log_group_arn   = "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789876:log-group:/aws/cloudfront/cdn-prod-access-logs:*"
  log_stream_name = "CloudFront_EA123456789EEAA"
}
```

##### Install: GCP

Coming soon!

#### Analyze

##### Analyze: Retainless Cloud

##### Analyze: CLI

To install `retainless` (CLI), you will need to
[configure NPM for the GitHub registry](https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-package-registry/),
which even for public packages requires a
[Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
(the new fine-grained tokens are not yet supported). Replace `GITHUB_TOKEN` with your `ghp_ABC` token:

```bash
echo '//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=GITHUB_TOKEN' >> ~/.npmrc
echo '@retainless:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com' >> ~/.npmrc
npm install -g @retainless/cli

# to upgrade the CLI:
npm install -g @retainless/cli@latest
```

Once installed, the CLI is easy to use, and includes `--help` command for more info:

```bash
$ retainless --help
Usage: retainless [options] [command]

Options:
  -s --start <string>  Earliest period (default: "2025-10-01")
  -e --end <string>    Latest period (default: "2025-10-31")
  -h, --help           display help for command

Commands:
  daily-churn          survival rate of users based on their first visit
  daily-retention      daily retention rate of users
  weekly-retention     weekly retention rate of users
  help [command]       display help for command
```

Or for a specific metric:

```bash
$ retainless daily-churn --help
Usage: retainless daily-churn [options]

Survival rate (or fall-off rate) is the number of users who still find your site
useful after a specified number of days, as measured by the duration between
their first visit and their last visit.

Example output:

CohortDay,DayOffset,UsersSurviving,PoolSize,CohortSize
2025-10-08,0,100,100,100
2025-10-08,1,25,100,100
2025-10-08,2,22,25,100
2025-10-08,3,20,22,100
2025-10-08,4,18,20,100
2025-10-09,0,100,100,100
2025-10-09,1,25,100,100
2025-10-09,2,20,25,100
2025-10-09,3,16,20,100

Options:
  -h, --help  display help for command
```

The output of a metric command is always a CSV file, and status is saved to `STDERR`, so you can pipe `STDOUT` to a file
or other program:

```bash
retainless --start 2025-10-01 --end 2025-10-31 daily-churn > ~/Documents/DailyChurn.csv
```

### Architecture

**Log Processor:**

```plantuml
@startuml
title Retainless Architecture: Log Processor

boundary Lambda
database DynamoDB
database CloudWatch

[-> Lambda: EventBridge Scheduler\nDaily, early morning ~2AM local
Lambda -> DynamoDB: Read all `Period` rows\n& their salts
Lambda -> Lambda: Generate new `Period` range\n from last `Period` end to midnight
Lambda -> DynamoDB: Read `Users` in any known `Period`\n(aka hashable users)
Lambda -> CloudWatch: Query access logs for `Period` range
group
  Lambda -> Lambda: Group access logs by UserId (today's\nfingerprint): `hash(ip + ua + salt + secret)`
end
group
  Lambda -> Lambda: Calculate `sessionLength` and\n`requestCount`
  Lambda -> Lambda: Hash `ip + ua` with `salt + secret`\nof all prior `Period` rows
  alt If any match
    Lambda -> Lambda: Link & copy to `priorVisits` array
    note right Lambda: When we lose the prior `Period` salt\nwe will also lose the ability to discover &\nlink Users of that Period. By copying, we\nhave "renewed" this user for a fresh\nretention period under a new UserId.\n\nThis has impacts on statistic calculation!
  end
end
Lambda -> DynamoDB: Write new `Period` with 30-day expiry
Lambda -> DynamoDB: Write new `User` rows for new `Period`

== Later ==

CloudWatch -> CloudWatch: Retention period\nexpiration
DynamoDB -> DynamoDB: TTL expiration of\nold `Period` rows 
```

**CLI (Statistics):**

The Retainless statistics system can seem complex at first, but understanding a few fundamental concepts can simplify
it:

1. **Session Storage**:  
   Sessions are saved as `UserId # Period` in the KV database. For privacy:
    - We avoid copying prior UserIds into priorVisits, to ensure visitors are anonymous.

2. **Visitors vs. Sessions**:  
   When querying a date range (e.g., `2025-10-06 to 2025-10-13`), each user visit in the range is treated as an
   independent session.
    - Example: A user visiting every day in the range will appear 7 times, unlinked between visits.

3. **Calculating Visitors**:
    - Each session tracks how many times the user visited before (e.g., their last visit will show 6 priorVisits, the
      previous session will show 5, etc.).
    - When counting metrics like *churn*, we count one user's 7 sessions as:
        - Add `+1` for each `UserId # Period`.
        - Subtract `-1` for all priorVisit periods to undo the previous row.

4. **Query Preparation**:
   To ensure accurate counts, queries include:
    - Periods between the `--start` and `--end` dates.
    - Any periods referenced by priorVisits.
        - Wit
          results.
